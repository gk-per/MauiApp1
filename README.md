# MauiApp1
.NET MAUI sample application. Created from Visual Studio Preview template. 
Displays a simple counter and button to increment counter.

MAUI is interesting because it allows a write-once, run-anywhere approach to mobile native application development.
MAUI is currently only available in .NET 6 Preview 2.
